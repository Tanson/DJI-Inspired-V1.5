# Summary

![Inspire V1.5](http://i.imgur.com/DxfXdA1.gif?raw=true)
Want a DJI Inspire One but don't want to spend $3K? Then this is the 3D printing project for you! The cost of building the frame and landing gear is only around $100. Add your electronics and get in the air for far less than DJI would charge.

This is my project that evolved from the idea RCHobbiesUK developed. The RCGroups community took off from their inspiration and mutated their design into an entirely new beast that has considerable improvements.  

The full list of options, print settings, print checklist, hardware, electronics, wiring, and everything else can be read in full at the RCGroups thread http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2399740#post31442294  
  
The complete set of modeling files is on that page as well! So if you want to put your own twist on my design you won;t need to start from scratch.
